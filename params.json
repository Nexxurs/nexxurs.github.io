{"name":"Nexxurs.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to my Github Page!\r\nAt the moment I'm working on a little program containing the Riot Games API. If you wanna know more, please check it out at my [League of Streamers Repository](https://github.com/Nexxurs/LeagueOfStreamers).\r\n\r\n## Overview \r\n\r\nThis Program is made for Streamers, who want to show their Division on their stream and can easily update those informations. \r\n\r\nI've just finished the first runnable version, so please tell me if you like it, find bugs or everything else what comes to your mind. \r\n\r\n[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/Wwy10)\r\n\r\n## Where to start \r\n\r\n### Get the Program\r\n\r\nJust download the pre-compiled version or download the sourcecode and compile it yourself. If you want to do it yourself, you need your own Riot API Key, which will be put in a new constant.java file into the src/main folder. (Thats need to be that way, because I cant make the key public)\r\n\r\n### How to use it \r\n\r\nJust add your Summoner Name to the List and press the sync button whenever you want the files to be updated. (If you just added the summoner, the first sync will add the files)\r\nYour stats will be in different .txt files, which will be in your user/document directory. If you are unsure where the files are, press the !-Button at the top right corner to get the whole path. \r\n\r\n### Contribution\r\n\r\nAll the code, inclusive the Riot API, is written by myself. The icons are desinged by Freepik.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
